# What is this?

![stealth_beta.png](Images/stealth_beta.png)
A laser cut and bent single piece bed concept, trying to implement a lightweight and stiff bed with full access to the mounting screws.

# Where can I get it? 

I only did a small prototype run and will not be able to sell it myself, however there are a few Voron related shops that started stocking it:

# Kiriwhat?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirigami>

# BOM
- 1x Kirigami Bed
- 8x M2x4 to mount the bed to the carriages
- 4x M3 Heatsets + 4x M3x6 screws for the leadscrew mount
- 4x M3 Heatsets + 2 M3x6 screws for the chain mount
- 1x M3 Heatset + 1 M3x6 screw for the wire guide

# Versions
- V2: added a cutout for the thermal fuse
- V3: slots instead of holes for the bed springs, allowing to adjust the Y offset over a 3mm range to support V0.0 as well as the sherpa mini mod. 

# Installation
The guys from Maple Leaf Makers made a nice tutorial on how to convert the stock bed to Kirigami.
