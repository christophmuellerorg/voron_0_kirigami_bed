# What is this?

![stealth_beta.png](Images/stealth_beta.png)
A laser cut and bent single piece bed concept, trying to implement a lightweight and stiff bed with full access to the mounting screws.

# Where can I get it? 

I only did a small prototype run and will not be able to sell it myself, however there are a few Voron related shops that started stocking it:

- [Fabreeko](https://www.fabreeko.com/products/voron-v0-1-kirigami-bed-kit-by-ldo?_pos=1&_sid=dece420eb&_ss=r&variant=43178853531903) (US)

# Versions
- V2: added a cutout for the thermal fuse

# Installation
The guys from Maple Leaf Makers made a nice tutorial on how to convert the stock bed to Kirigami.
